# Doze
Doze is an intelligent sleep journal that helps users identify daily habits that affect quality of sleep. Doze learns from historical data, and provides users with a percentage based prediction of whether or not the user will feel well rested the next day. Users can preview different scenarios of actions to understand how different activities affect them.

Users can also view historical entries and look into details of which actions they completed on specific days and see snapshots of Doze's predicted chance of feeling well rested for each historical entry. Users can also delete historical entries and sort by most recent and oldest entries.

In the trends section of the app, users can view which activities they completed when they were well rested and when they were not well rested, as well as see how many hours slept in recent entries, which days they felt well rested, how Doze's predictions are changing over time, and other metrics.
